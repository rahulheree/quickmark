Tired of losing track of important links and wanting a 100% private alternative to cloud-based bookmarking services, I decided to build my own solution. I created QuickMark, a simple and fast link-saver, using only HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It runs entirely in your browser with no backend or sign-up needed, keeping your data completely yours. #JavaScript #WebDevelopment #Productivity #Privacy
